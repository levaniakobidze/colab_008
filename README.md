### 🎯 What we learned

Throughout the project, we learned how to use Git to manage our codebase and collaborate effectively.

We made use of Git branches to work on different features and bug fixes independently. This allowed us to make changes to the codebase without affecting the main branch. We also used pull requests to review and merge changes back into the main branch. This helped us ensure that our code was well-tested and met the project requirements before merging.
